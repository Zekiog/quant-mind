# QuantMind Dev

Development workflow for contributing to the QuantMind codebase.

## Start Here

1. Read the repository root `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` for the stable
   architecture constraints and the module map.
2. Pick exactly one workflow reference below; do not load the others.

## Select Workflow

- Committing staged work → `references/commit.md`
- Opening or updating a pull request → `references/pull-request.md`
- Implementing or refactoring anything under `quantmind/` →
  `references/develop-components.md` (read it **before** writing code)

A feature task usually chains all three: develop → commit → pull request.

## Rules

- `bash scripts/verify.sh` is the single "shippable" gate. CI runs the same
  script; run it before every push and before marking a PR ready.
- Never bypass pre-commit / pre-push hooks (`--no-verify`) unless the user
  explicitly authorizes it.
- New features ship with a unit test and a focused example (see
  `references/develop-components.md`).
- This skill is mirrored under `.agents/skills/quantmind-dev/` and
  `.claude/skills/quantmind-dev/`; the copies are identical. When changing
  the skill, update both in the same change.

## Boundaries

- This skill is for contributing to QuantMind itself. It does not cover
  using QuantMind as a library in your own project.
- Product decisions (new modules, new dependencies, API redesigns) need an
  issue and maintainer discussion first; do not encode them here.
